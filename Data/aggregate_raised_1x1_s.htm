Source : I-ATTC (EASTERN PACIFIC) Years :
1980-1997  --- Aggregated purse seine data
provided by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (I-ATTC) covering the Eastern Pacific
Ocean.

Status prior to May 2006 when the first provision
of data arrived under the SPC-IATTC Data Exchange
Agreement.

IATTC no longer requires SPC to request
authorisation for each use. If SPC uses the IATTC
data for purposes with which IATTC is not already
familiar, then SPC will provide a draft
publication to IATTC for comment. SPC will assume
that IATTC is familiar with all research and
statistical work that has been reported to
meetings of SCTB. Further, if SPC receives a
request from a third party for the IATTC data,
then SPC will refer the request to IATTC.

The catch stratified by set type is approximate
because the number of sets and species catch per
set type were provided only. The balance (i.e. the
difference between)  the sum of the catches by set
type and the total catch, by species, has been put
into the catch for unspecified set type for each
species.

Catch and effort (sets) broken down by FLOATING
OBJECTS is included in the LOG sets at this stage.

Data are stratified by month and 1°x1° grid.

Coverage is near 100% for days fished, sets,
skipjack and yellowfin catch, but logsheet data
have not been adjusted according to unloadings
data.

Data provided in May 2006 include fleet details.

Raised bigeye catch and effort (days and sets) for
years 1962-1998 have been provided in a separate
distribution (May 1999) to the OFP for the
Pacific-wide Bigeye Assessment project. The effort
data have been stored in special fields not
accessible by the CES database system.

Note that in the generation of the BEST data for
the Eastern Pacific Fleets, the following data are
not included from the aggregate data provided by
IATTC

1.   US Purse seine catch/effort for the WCPFC
Conventional Area (since this is assumed to be
already available from the logsheet data (Treaty)
and the ATA aggregate data (pre-Treaty), provided
directly to SPC.

2.  The Spanish Purse seine catch/effort data for
the WCPFC Conventiona Area for 1999 and 2000 -

_________________________________________________

The best estimate of catch and effort available
for Indonesian purse seine vessels operating in
and around Indonesian waters.

These data have been generated from annual catch
estimates presented in the most recent version of
the Tuna Fishery Yearbook. Catch and effort
estimates have been determined for this fleet in
the following manner:

*       An estimate of  the spatial distribution
of the catch and effort for this fleet has been
largely determined using information provided by
Dr A.D. Lewis and data compiled from the
Philippines Tuna Research Project (PTRP) - Landed
Catch and Effort Monitoring Programme (LCEM).
Catch has been apportioned to 5°x5° grids thought
to best represent the spatial distribution of the
catch for this fleet (i.e. according to LCEM data
).  As the purse seine database contains data to
the level of 1°x1° grid, each 5°x5° grid catch has
been divided into equal 1°x1° grids representing
that 5°x5° grids catch (taking into account those
1°x1° grids which are exclusively land).

*       The species composition of yellowfin and
skipjack has been determined from the YEARBOOK
data; the estimated proportion of Bigeye in the
Yellowfin catch has been determined from the LCEM
data.

*       The catch per unit effort (CPUE) for
skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye has been determined
from all purse seine data for that Month for an
area of the WCPO in the vicinity of Philippines
(0-25N, 100-150E). Given the total CPUE, effort
(expressed in days fishing) has also been
determined by application to the catch data.

*       The temporal distribution of the catch has
been determined by simply dividing the catch into
equal twelve month portions. (We hope to
eventually use the LCEM data to build in some
seasonality).

DUE CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN USING THESE
DATA DUE TO THE COARSE ESTIMATES OF CPUE APPLIED
IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

The data are stratified by month and 1°x1° grid.

Data for years 1967-2002 have been provided
specifically for SPC use and, therefore, are not
available to parties outside of SPC without prior
authorisation from Japan. At this stage, catch and
effort data for 2002 is considered preliminary.
(Latest provision of data : 15th April 2003 by N.
Miyabe)

Other than the cases mentioned in the previous
paragraph, the data provided are believed to
represent 100% coverage for the Japanese tropical
purse seine fishery.

Prior to 1983, effort was expressed in the number
of fishing days only, but since this time, effort
is measured in the number of days fishing and
searching.

Note that these data are stratified by set type.

Authorisation for release of these data must be
sought from NFRDI. The data are stratified by
month and 1°x1° grid.

Coverage is considered good since 1994, but is
considered poor prior to this time. Note that
prior to 1994, the coverage is considered  better
that the logsheet data provided to SPC from member
countries.

Original data included effort that was expressed
in the number of fishing days only, and not the
number of days fishing and searching. The effort
has therefore been adjusted to include "days
searching" by taking the proportion of "Days
fishing and searching" to "Days fishing", by year,
from the logsheet data and applying it to the
effort (days fishing only) in the aggregate data.
This applies to data covering the period
1980-1995.

The database contains aggregated data provided by
National Fisheries Research and Development
Institute (NFRDI) of Korea, for the Korean purse
seine fleet operating in the Pacific Ocean
(1980-1995). Data for years since 1996 come from
logsheets provided to SPC by member countries
where bilateral access arrangements with the
Korean purse seine fleet existed.

Note that effort is expressed in the number of
fishing days only, and not the number of days
fishing and searching for years 1980-1995 (as
provided by NFRDI), and an estimate of effort
(days fishing and searching) has been determined
for this period from logsheet data processed at
SPC.

Note that the data provided by NFRDI are not
stratified by set type, but a procedure has been
applied to the Korean aggregate data to provide
estimates of catch/effort by set type. Estimates
of catch and effort by set type have been
determined from logsheet data provided to SPC via
member countries; these estimates may be available
at the finest resolution possible (i.e. by 1°x1°
grid/month) or it may be necessary to use very
coarse estimates where logbook data are not
available (i.e. for years prior to 1979). The
procedure then involves portioning the total
species catch and effort (sets) according to the
estimated breakdown by set type.

Estimates for the proportion of  bigeye expected
in the reported catch of yellowfin have been
determined using a procedure described in the
latest version of the SPC TUNA FISHERY YEARBOOK.

The best estimate of catch and effort available
for Philippines purse seine vessels operating in
and around Philippines waters.

These data have been generated from annual catch
estimates presented in the most recent version of
the Tuna Fishery Yearbook. Catch and effort
estimates have been determined for this fleet in
the following manner:

*       An estimate of  the spatial distribution
of the catch and effort for this fleet has been
largely determined using the data compiled from
the Philippines Tuna Research Project (PTRP) -
Landed Catch and Effort Monitoring Programme
(LCEM). Catch has been apportioned to 5°x5° grids
thought to best represent the spatial distribution
of the catch for this fleet (i.e. according to
LCEM data ).  As the purse seine database contains
data to the level of 1°x1° grid, each 5°x5° grid
catch has been divided into equal 1°x1° grids
representing that 5°x5° grids catch (taking into
account those 1°x1° grids which are exclusively
land).

*       The species composition of yellowfin and
skipjack has been determined from the YEARBOOK
data; the estimated proportion of Bigeye in the
Yellowfin catch has been determined from the LCEM
data.

*       The catch per unit effort (CPUE) for
skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye has been determined
from all purse seine data for that Month for an
area of the WCPO in the vicinity of Philippines
(0-25N, 100-150E). Given the total CPUE, effort
(expressed in days fishing) has also been
determined by application to the catch data.

*       The temporal distribution of the catch has
been determined by simply dividing the catch into
equal twelve month portions. (We hope to
eventually use the LCEM data to build in some
seasonality).

DUE CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN USING THESE
DATA DUE TO THE COARSE ESTIMATES OF CPUE APPLIED
IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

Estimates for the proportion of  bigeye expected
in the reported catch of yellowfin have been
determined using a procedure described in the
latest version of the SPC TUNA FISHERY YEARBOOK.

Catch reported on logsheets prior to 1993 are
known to be under-reported with respect to effort
(days fishing and searching), which results in
lower than actual CPUE.

To rectify these anolmalies, the following has
been done :

1.      Apply the Korean purse seine total CPUE,
broken down by year, month, area and school
association to adjust the catch in the Chinese
Taipei data for the period 1983-1992.
2.      Then, adjust the catch and effort in the
Chinese Taipei data for the period 1983-1992 to
correspond to the annual catch estimates by
multiplying by the proportion of the adjusted
total catch (see 1.) to the annual catch estimates
for this fleet.
